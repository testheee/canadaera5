                    <p class="mb-4"><strong></strong> Today, we will talk about how a novice investor should behave when making investments.I myself started out with the mentality that all investments are like a puzzle. In that, you need to understand where your money is going, and how to increase your income in the stock market.And the more I understood, the more I began to understand that investing is not about math and equations. It's much more about your investment philosophy and everyday habits.That's why I started investing my money with my name and contact details, and not in the usual way with my salary.In this article, we will talk about how to behave in turbulent times, and how not to lose money on investments.I also want to emphasize one important thing.No one in the world can accurately predict what the quotes will do in a month or two. But you need to understand what the market is doing, and what actions you can take during periods of high volatility.This is what has kept me on the market all this time:1) Do not touch your investment before the end of the year.This is the most important rule for your safety.Otherwise, you will not be able to protect your savings from losses, and you will sit in "wait and see".2) Do not bet against the market.Yes, occasionally you can get lucky. But, alas, such a "money miracle" has never happened in the history of stocks.Therefore, you should not even try to "catch the wind of change".":Yes, sometimes you can win big in the long run. Yes, you will eventually earn big. All this will be a pleasure. But not for you personally.All that money, by the way, you will need to pay it off!3) You must own a certain amount of stock.Yes, it's not a big secret that in the long run, stock prices tend to rise. But only if you have an ownership stake in the company that issued the shares you bought.Otherwise, you will not be able to protect your money from losses.4) You should not buy individual stocks.Because it is very easy to do this accidentally. In which case you will lose the money you invested.5) You should have a "shopping Plan" for your investment.This will allow you not to lose your money in vain.And also, you must have a" survival " in case of a prolonged "bear market.And a" Christmas " in case of an unexpected collapse in financial markets.Executive SUMMARY:1. In the long run, investing is rarely profitable. 2. While it is possible to get a significant "plus" by buying shares, this is rarely profitable. 1) Read my article " Where NOT to invest money?
